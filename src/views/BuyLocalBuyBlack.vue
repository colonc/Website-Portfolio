                Technical co-lead in a five-person team. We focused on helping a Philadelphia based grocery co-op, Weavers Way, take steps to diversify their supply chain and deliver on their racial equity commitments through finding and visualizing demorgraphic data about local food producers. 
                This project added 400 hous of capacity to the diversity vendor workstream - equivalent to giving the diversity vendor coordinator a 1.5 year head start in the role as well as created new oppotunities for collaboraion and sharing with local are coops.
