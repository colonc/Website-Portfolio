                    <p class="subtitle is-4 has-text-left is-family-secondary"> My name is Cassandra Colón and I recently had the honor to blaze the trail and become the first generation of college graduates in my family. 
                        It has taken many late nights, continuous breaking out of my comfort zone, and persevering effort, but I can proudly say that I have accomplished my goal. 
                        However, the trail does not end here as I continue to set new goals for myself.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle is-4 has-text-left is-family-secondary "> In terms of career interests, the technology, design and data spaces have piqued my interest, however, I enjoy working wherever I can find a new challenge. 
                            I have found myself working well and thriving in many different settings, from a variety of roles in company offices, classrooms, restaurants, and even on a farm. 
                            I enjoy learning new skills and finding inventive ways to adapt to my current surroundings.</p>
